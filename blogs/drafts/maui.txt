I started learning the Microsoft cross platform (Android/IOS/Windows/Mac) framework .NET MAUI in Janurary of this year. I relished the idea of being able to code for many differen't platforms from one code base. Maui is a relatively new framework which appears to me to be the successor of Xamarin. Xamarin is limited to IOS/Android from my understanding so MAUI includes Windows and Mac. Spoiler alert, not all was well in my MAUI learning/dev experience. I had my suspisions early on that being able to code for so many operating systems with a new technology was going to have some major issues and I came to find out, I was right. Everything was going well until I tried to access a MYSQL Database.
