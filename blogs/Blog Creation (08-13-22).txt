Created this PHP/HTML/CSS & JS blogging system to show blogs automatically from discrete .txt files (Single entries) on a single page and give it some flair with headers that are colored differently and that are created from the text files name. Blog dates are pulled from the .txt files modification stamps and shown right aligned. Also added a nav at the top that auto generates. I am quite pleased.
