<center><img src="/blogs/imgs/docker.png" width="5%"></center><br>Played around with <a href="https://docker.com" target="_blank">Docker</a> some time ago and found it to be a very compelling technology. Why use a whole virtual machine when you can run your apps in a self contained container where all the app's dependencies are available to it? Using official Docker Images and <a href="https://hub.docker.com/" target="_blank">Docker Hub</a> is the way to go. I am running a PHP Docker Image with Apache httpd as well as a MariaDB (MySQL) Docker image on my home server. Everything is going swimmingly so far.
