<center><img src="/blogs/imgs/maui.png" width="20%" height="20%"></center><br>Started learning the Microsoft cross platform (Android/IOS/Windows/Mac) framework .NET MAUI in January of this year. Relish the idea of being able to code for many different platforms from one code base. Maui is a relatively new framework which appears to me to be the successor of Xamarin. Xamarin is limited to IOS/Android from my understanding so MAUI includes Windows and Mac.
