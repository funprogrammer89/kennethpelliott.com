I have created a Python app that keeps track of changes to a specified directory. It creates a 'files.json' file that stores files and hashes of files. It will alert you if a file has been removed, changed or created. I plan to add FTP functionality so I can replace my need for Git_FTP use as I have found a few bugs that are making me uneasy. One such bug is the fact that it won't tell you if an upload failed but instead makes you believe that everything has completed successfully sometimes. I don't like this so I am writing a replacement app. The source code is found <a href="https://github.com/funprogrammer89/directoryChanges">here</a>.
